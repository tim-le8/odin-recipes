# odin-recipes

In this project, I will be practicing the HTML knowledge that I have previously acquired.

I will also apply git basics while working on this project.

The current project will involve writing a recipe.

This will include HTML headers, paragraphs, and lists.

Self-notes:
- do several 'git add' + 'git commit' cycles before pushing it with 'git push origin main'
